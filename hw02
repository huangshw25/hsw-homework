Information：

Information is any entity or form that provides the answer to a question of some kind or resolves uncertainty.
It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge 
signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts.[1] As it regards data, the information's existence 
is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of 
knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer.

Software bug
A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or 
unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. The process of fixing bugs is termed "debugging" and often uses formal 
techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs, and since the 1950s, some computer systems have been designed to also deter, detect or 
auto-correct various computer bugs during operations.
