3)使用 -1, 0, 1, 15, 26，3265 最为输入测试你的程序
2、名词解释与对比
1)Top-down design 
  Top -down design can affect lots of area like the architecture, software engineering , computer science and so on.Today I am   
gonna tell you what I have learned after reading the introduction of Top - down design from Wikipedia.
According to Wikipedia,there are two basic rule that control the world which are top —down and bottom - up ,both of them are   
commonest routine in the creatures brain.
  For example ,the human beings,here are two indicators of our daily life .One is when we first find a new flower ,our mind will  
be grasped due to its visually color,that is the bottom up effect. The other is the time when we designing a model,we will   
initially consider it’s main look rather than the details ,only if we manage the design ,we will consider the detail function   
and turn to find the way to complete it,that is the Top-down effect.
There is no doubt that the Top -down design cost less time than bottom top design,however.It may cost more money because of   
sometimes we must invent some tools to fulfill the function,but me,as a computer scientist,would prefer the top down design,I  
think the supposed to be the most effective way to solve the problem .By the way,many people like me should use our analyst   
skill more often ,that how we survive on the earth.
  
2) Work breakdown structure (WBS)
  The work-breakdown structure provides a common framework for the natural development of the overall planning and control of a  
contract and is the basis for dividing work into definable increments from which the statement of work can be developed and  
technical, schedule, cost, and labor hour reporting can be established.[4]
A work breakdown structure permits summing of subordinate costs for tasks, materials, etc., into their successively higher   
level "parent" tasks, materials, etc. For each element of the work breakdown structure, a description of the task to be   
performed is generated.[5] This technique (sometimes called a system breakdown structure[6]) is used to define and organize   
the total scope of a project.
  The WBS is organized around the primary products of the project (or planned outcomes) instead of the work needed to produce  
the products (planned actions). Since the planned outcomes are the desired ends of the project, they form a relatively stable   
set of categories in which the costs of the planned actions needed to achieve them can be collected. A well-designed WBS makes  
it easy to assign each project activity to one and only one terminal element of the WBS. In addition to its function in cost   
accounting, the WBS also helps map requirements from one level of system specification to another, for example a requirements  
cross reference matrix mapping functional requirements to high level or low level design documents. The WBS may be displayed   
horizontally in outline form, or vertically as a tree structure (like an organization chart).
The development of the WBS normally occurs at the start of a project and precedes detailed project and task planning.

3)简述管理学 WBS 与 信息学Top-down设计 的异同
I think that WBS is a dividing action but top down is a design concept .
3、仔细观察您洗衣机的运作过程，运用Top-down设计方法和Pseudocode 描述洗衣机控制程序。假设洗衣机可执行的基本操作如下: water_in_switch(open_close) // open 打开上水开关，close关闭 water_out_switch(open_close) // open 打开排水开关，close关闭 get_water_volume() //返回洗衣机内部水的高度
Top and down 
Washing machine 
1.首先设计洗衣机的外观，做好防水装置
2.设计排水管和入水管的位置
3.设计风筒的旋转速度
4.最后才设计程序
设计程序使用伪代码
void washing machine 
{
Void switch_on_and_switch_off
Void open()
{
If press the bottom on on type 
Do water_in
If press the bottom on off type
Do stop the machine
}
Void water_out_switch
{
If press the bottom of water out
Do 
Floating the water 
If press the bottom of water  out and water _volume reach the highest
Do
End Floating the water
Returned to the washing_machine
}
Void get_highest_water 
{
Give the time after press the bottom of water out ->time
If the time over 5 mins
Do
End floating the water 
Returning to  washing_machine 
}



motor_run(direction) // 电机转动。left左转，right右转，stop停 time_counter() // 返回当前时间计数，以秒为单位 halt(returncode) //  
停机，success 成功 failure 失败
1)请使用伪代码分解“正常洗衣”程序的大步骤。包括注水、浸泡等 

Void washing_machine
{
motor_run
Time_counter
decide_to_stop
}
void motor_run
{
While the time isn’t over 10 min 
Do
{
Left}
While the time is over 10min but less than 20 min
{Do 
Right
While the time is over 20min}
{Do
 left for 10 min 
Right for 10 min
Until 40min }
Void time counter
{
If the water on
Count the time until the machine stop
}
Void identify
{
Time counter
If the time counter over 40min
Print success
Else
Print fail


2)进一步用基本操作、控制语句(IF、FOR、WHILE等)、变量与表达式，写出每 个步骤的伪代码 
I’ve finished it on the top side

3)根据你的实践，请分析“正常洗衣”与“快速洗衣”在用户目标和程序上的异同。 你认为是否存在改进(创新)空间，简单说明你的改进意见? 
  Well , after doing the pseudo code ,I found that regular washing machine code can control the main part of the machine ,  
but if we want to design our machine for the costumer,we can add some function to domain there need ,I think it is not   
really hard to develop a new washing machine,but it should have the domain. 

4)通过步骤3)，提取一些共性功能模块(函数)，简化“正常洗衣”程序，使程序 变得更利于人类理解和修改维护。例如:
wait(time) //等待指定的时间;
注水(volume,timeout) //在指定时间内完成注水，否则停机; 排水(timeout)。 等子程序
The mutual function:
Washing_machine , motor_run , switch and time control

   These function can  be applied to all kind of machine ,it could save a lot of time ,As human being,ourselves, we should use   
 our brain on finding new function ,successfullly invent new thing which can truly develop our life rather than keep fighting  
 with the same thing .
